        "Recall, when `MTH229` is loaded, the same prime\nnotation of mathematics is available in `Julia` for indicating\nderivatives of functions (through `ForwardDiff`).\n\n\n\n## Quick background\n\nRead about this material here: [Exploring first and second derivatives with Julia](http://mth229.github.io/first-second-derivatives.html).\n\n\nFor the impatient, this assignment looks at the relationship between a\nfunction, $f(x)$, and its first and second derivatives: $f'(x)$ and\n$f''(x)$. The basic relationship can be summarized (though the devil\nis in the details) by:\n\n* If the first derivative is *positive* on $(a,b)$ then the function\n  is *increasing* on $(a,b)$.\n\n* If the second derivative is *positive* on $(a,b)$ then the function\n  is *concave up* on $(a,b)$.\n\n(The \"devil\" here is that the converse statements are usually - but not always - true.)\n\n\nSome key  definitions are:\n\n* A **critical** point of $f$ is a value in the domain of $f(x)$ for which the derivative is $0$ or undefined. These are often---but **not always**---where $f(x)$ has a local maximum or minimum.\n\n* An **inflection point** of $f$ is a value in the domain of $f(x)$ where the concavity of $f$ *changes*. (These are *often*---but **not always**---where $f''(x)=0$.)\n\n\nThese two relationships and definitions are put to use to characterize\n*local extrema* of a function via one of two \"derivative\" tests:\n\n\n* The **first derivative test**:  This states that  if $c$ is a critical point of $f(x)$ then if $f'(x)$ changes sign from $+$ to $-$ at $c$ then $f(c)$ is a local maximum and if $f'(x)$ changes sign from $-$ to $+$ then $f(c)$ is a local minimum. If there is no sign change, then $f(c)$ is neither a local minimum or maximum.\n\n* The **second derivative test**: This states that if $c$ is a critical point of $f(x)$ and $f''(c) > 0$ then $f(c)$ is a local minimum and if $f''(c) < 0$ then $f(c)$ is a local maximum. The test says nothing about the case $f''(c) = 0$.\n\n----\n\nWe investigate these concepts in `Julia` both graphically and numerically.\n\nFor the graphical exploration, the `plotif` function from the `MTH229` package is quite useful.\nIt is used to plot a function `f` using two colors; the color choice depending on\nwhether the second function, `g` is positive or not. (Basically it does `plot(f, a, b); plot!(x -> g(x) > 0.0 ? f(x) : NaN, a, b)`.)\n\n\nThis function can be used to graphically illustrate where the graph of `f` is *positive*, *increasing*, or *concave up*:\n`plotif(f, f, a, b)` will show a different color when $f(x)$ is\n*positive*, `plotif(f, f', a, b)` will show a different color when\n$f(x)$ is *increasing*, and  `plotif(f, f'', a, b)` will show a different color when\n$f(x)$ is *concave up*. For example, here we see where the following `f` is increasing:"

The\n`fzeros` function returns a container of values, which may, of course,\nbe empty.\n\nFor example to find a zero in `f` near `1.5` we would first graph.

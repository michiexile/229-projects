        "----\n\n\n### Quick background\n\nRead about this material here: [Approximate derivatives in julia](http://mth229.github.io/derivatives.html).\n\nFor the impatient, A secant line connecting points on the graph of $f(x)$ between $x=c$ and $x = c+h$ has slope:\n\n$$~\n\\frac{f(c+h) - f(c)}{h}.\n~$$\n\n\nThe slope of the tangent line to the graph of\n$f(x)$ at the point $(c,f(c))$ is given by taking the limit as $h$ goes to $0$:\n\n$$~\n\\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(c + h) - f(c)}{h}.\n~$$\n\nThe notation for this - when the limit exists - is $f'(c)$.\n\n\n\nIn general the derivative of a function $f(x)$ is the function\n$f'(x)$, which returns the slope of the tangent line for each $x$\nwhere it is defined. For many functions, finding the derivative is\nstraightforward, though may be complicated enough to seek alternatives. At times approximating the\nvalue is desirable.\n\n#### Approximate derivatives\n\nWe can approximate the slope of the tangent line several ways. The\n*forward difference quotient* takes a small value of $h$ and uses the\nvalue $(f(x+h) - f(x))/h$ as an approximation.\n\n\nFor example, to estimate the derivative of $x^{\\ln(x)}$ at $c=2$ with `h=1e-6` we could have"

Though this\ncan be pushed to return a function giving the derivative at any point,\nwe will use the more convenient solution described next for finding\nthe derivative as a function, when applicable.\n\n\n#### Automatic derivatives\n\nIn mathematics we use the notation $f'(x)$ to refer the function that\nfinds the derivative of $f(x)$ at a given $x$. The `MTH229` package\nprovides the same notation in `Julia`.\nIn  the  background, this uses *automatic differentiation*, as provided by\nthe `ForwardDiff` package, to\ncompute the  derivative. Automatic differentiation is a tad slower than using a\nhand-computed derivative, but as accurate as that, and much easier and   more  accurate than using an\n*approximate derivative*.\n\n\nThe `MTH229` package, using `ForwardDiff.derivative`, overloads  the default meaning of `'` allowing the usual notation for a derivative to be used:"

Such a function, `tangent(f,c)` is found in the `MTH229` package.
